about
this was made by laclica to automate the first setup of a windows machine. getting basic softwares in AND remove bloatwares from windows 10

if you are running a version of windows previous to 10 you can run as admin the installchocolatey.bat and installsoftwares.bat files in that order to setup your windows without the win 10 debloating.

enjoy
